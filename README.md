<h1 align="center">Hi CodSoft ManagersðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">I have uploaded three different files onto this GtHub repository. These files each contain the code and relevant data for each section of the level 1 tasks. To view them on GitHub pages it is important to segment the files into seperate repositories to allow github to render the data accurately and so that the files coordination aligns with the code itself. </h3>
